## 1. Introduction

As today`s interactive online services are developing at the speed of light, their natural characteristics had caused huge pressure on traditional cloud computing platform at 3 aspects: development, deployment and administration. But, these seem like conflict requirements.

Take an example. 4 months after the launch event that WeChat is published at 2011, it only takes 4 million users. But the number of active users grows to 800 million at the second quarter this year, what a tremendous growing speed.

From the aspect of service provider, in order to meet the strict requirements that originated from WeChat-like services and their light-speed development, the underlying    cloud computing platform must be *highly scalable* to satify the endless growing users. It also requires *rapid development* to settle the attacks from other familiar services. Furthermore, it clients also demands *low-latency* respond as it is a instant chatting service. Finally, to keep the user-stickness, it also has to guarantee the *availability* for their personal data.

But from the aspect of all three kinds of stakeholders, situations become complicated. Admins wants it to become easy-deployed with high-available policy. Developers wants it can be managed in an automatic way with consistant ACID transactions. And users wants it high-available with good experience naturally.

<p style="text-align: center">Fig.1 Requirements from all stakeholders</p>

To tackle all this seemingly conflict requirements, we had create tons of new technologies. For example, we use Bigtable to imporve the growing scale, MySQL Failover for wide-area replication and MySQL for ACID tarnsaction.

As far as we know, the more modules a single project has, the more complicated it will be. Therefore, an uniform platform integrating  all the benefits within Bigtable, MySQL and MySQL Failover is necessary for the future development of interactive online services.

## 2. Availability and Scale

Unfortunate, the hardwares is of limited scale and availability. What worse, the data is not stored in the same datacenter as before. Therefore, to settle down this problem, we have to focus on system design, so that the whole system can be bound in an proper way with minimum disadvantages.

So far, we had two pratical way to achieve it:

1.  **For Availability**
    
    We had inplemented a synchronous, Fault-tolerant log replicator to optimized for long-distance data links(i.e.,  by Chubby).

2.  **For Scale**

    We also introduced NoSQL data storage with its own replicated log(i.e. by Bigtable), to maximize the data scale.

### 2.1 Replication Algorithms

Before we actually step into the door of Megastore, we should have a brief understanding of current replication algorithms, in order to get a better understanding of Megastore`s approach.

#### 2.1.1 Traditional Algorithms

Currently, we had three kinds of traditional algorithms.

1.  **Asynchronous Master/Slave**

    Master maintains the writes ahead log. If there are appends to the replication log, master will be acknowledged in parallel with slave through Message Queue(MQ). But it had a obvious weakness: if the target slave is down, data loss will occur. Therefore an additional consensus protocol is needed.
2.  **Synchronous Master/Slave**

    Master informs its slaves after the changes are applied. But it also has its own weakness: needs a external system to keep the time.

3.  **Optimistic Replication**

    Mutations are propagating through the gourp asynchronous. As the order of propagation is unpredictable, it is impossible to 	implement transaction with such algorithm.

#### 2.1.2 Paxos

In Paxos, there are no distinguished master and slave. It use **vote** and catch up and to keep data consensus. This algorithm is selected by Google, and we will give a thorough explaination with exapmles to clerify the priceiples within it.
