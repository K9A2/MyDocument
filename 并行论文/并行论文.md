## 1. Introduction

As today`s interactive online services are developing at the speed of light, their natural characteristics had caused huge pressure on traditional cloud computing platform at 3 aspects: development, deployment and administration. But, these seem like conflict requirements.

Take an example. 4 months after the launch event that WeChat is published at 2011, it only takes 4 million users. But the number of active users grows to 800 million at the second quarter, what a tremendous speed.

From the aspect of service provider, to meet the strict requirements that origin from its light-speed development, its cloud computing platform must be *highly scalable* to satify the endless growing users. It also requires *rapid development* to settle the attacks from other familiar services. Furthermore, it clients also demands *low-latency* respond as it is a instant chatting service. Finally, to keep the user-stickness, it also has to guarantee the availability for their personal data.

But from the aspect of all three kinds of stakeholders, situations become complicated. Admins wants it to become easy-deployed with high-available policy. Developers wants it can be managed in an automatic way with consistant ACID transactions. And users wants it high-available with good experience naturally.

Fig.1 Requirements from all stakeholders

To tackle all this seemingly conflict requirements, we had create tons of techs. For example, we use Bigtable to imporve the growing scale, MySQL Failover for wide-area replication and MySQL for ACID tarnsaction.
